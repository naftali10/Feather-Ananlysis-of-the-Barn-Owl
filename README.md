# Feather Ananlysis of the Barn Owl  
This is a semesteral project of mine, made in 2012 during my studies at the Techion - the Israeli Institute of Technology.  
The project won the **Thomas Schwartz award of excellence** - the best project of the semester.  
A video demonstration of the GUI and operation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-JBPmPlk4I).
## Abstract  
The barn owl is a very common night owl. A research conducted at the department of zoology of TAU examines the spots on its belly.  
In this project, I built a software for their research. The software gets pictures of owls from the user, and produces statistical data about the spots on their plumage.  

## Technical information  
All of the development was in the laboratory of signal and image processing.  
Principles of image processing used:
* Image Correlation
* Bootom Hat operation
* K-Means Algorithm
